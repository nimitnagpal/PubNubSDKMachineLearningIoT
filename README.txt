Motivation:
America is world's largest waste producer, producing 500 million tons of waste every year, the striking fact being out of this only 5% is being recycled every year.
Whereas countries like sweden are importing waste from other countries with there, recycle percentage being 200%.
Why are we not interested in treating the waste?
This is because we don't realize the worth of our waste.

Solution:
Returning user the amount of recyclable waste everyday in a wallet, thus encouraging them to generate recyclable waste over other.
By this solution, we tend to classify the waste into categories based on sensor input data. 
Train a large dataset using SVM and KNN Machine Learing classification, using PUBNUB's python library. After the waste is being segregated the individual results are published through a PUBNUB channel and the end user, uses a dashboard, to see what part is contributing to major of the amount of the recycled waste.
